Earlier this year, designer Jerry Lorenzo revealed that his ever-popular Fear of God label would be crossing over into footwear. Now, we finally get our first look at brand’s inaugural footwear collection, which Jerry himself described as a hybrid between a sneaker and a military boot. Courtesy of Lorenzo’s Instagram, we see an initial design optioned in grey as well as black. The silhouette boasts a heightened build and a jagged outsole. Minimal branding is present, and a side zip entry should provide for easy on and off.

Stay tuned for more, but it appears Fear of God’s first-ever footwear drop will be a part of the imprint’s Holiday 2015 collection.

For a look at the brand’s most comprehensive delivery yet, check out their “FOURTH COLLECTION.”
